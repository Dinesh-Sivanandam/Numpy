# Numpy
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment.
# In this
1. Learn some basics about numpy with its syntax
2. Learn some interesting functions with its complexity of running
3. With notes i took
# We will see about:
1. for arange numbers
2. shape, size, datatype
3. Array
4. reshaping array
5. zeros - array full of zeros
6. ones - array filled with ones
7. empty - array filled with random values
8. Array copy
    - using array operator - Assignment copy - new array us not created but the variable points to the same reference
    - using view() or shallow copy - shallow copy - copies the references of the elements in the old array
    - using copy() or Deep copy - Deep copy - changes made in copy is not reflected to old array
9. Element search
    - Linear search or sequential search - n comparisions - return list of indexes
    - Binary Search - log(n) comparision  - array must in sorted order
10. Array manipulation
    - addition arr1+arr2
    - subtaction arr1-arr2
    - multiplication arr1*arr2  - for matrix multiplication we use arr1@arr2 for '.' operator else "arr1.dot(arr2)"
    - division arr1/arr2
    - modulus arr1%arr2
    - elements are not modified but returns a new array
    - we can also use compound operations like +=, -=, *=, etc..,
